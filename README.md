## Course Description

Modernizing and maintaining large codebases can be a daunting challenge, but automation can make the process efficient and scalable. This course explores how to leverage OpenRewrite and generative AI to automate mass-scale software refactoring, enabling seamless code transformations, migrations, and optimizations. Learn how to design and apply custom OpenRewrite recipes, integrate refactoring automation into CI/CD pipelines, and enhance developer productivity with AI-powered code modifications. Through hands-on examples and real-world scenarios, gain practical skills to modernize legacy systems, enforce coding standards, and improve software quality with minimal manual effort. By the end of this course, you will be equipped with the tools and techniques to drive large-scale, automated code improvements across your organization.
